# Next.js Migration Plan for Evently

Based on the analysis of the current frontend codebase and the backend API documentation, here's the plan for migrating to Next.js with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Current Structure
- Simple HTML/CSS/JS files
- Basic authentication (login/register)
- Event listing and viewing
- Profile page
- Calendar page

## Migration Steps

1. **Create a new Next.js project in a separate directory**
   - Use `create-next-app` with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and App Router
   - Set up Shadcn UI components

2. **Implement the following pages**:
   - Home page (/)  
   - Authentication pages (/login, /register)
   - Events pages (/events, /events/[id])
   - Create/Edit event pages (/events/create, /events/[id]/edit)
   - Profile page (/profile)
   - Calendar page (/calendar)

3. **Implement API integration**:
   - Authentication (register, login)
   - Event management (get all, get by ID, create, update)
   - User role management

4. **Implement UI components with Shadcn**:
   - Navigation bar
   - Authentication forms
   - Event cards and details
   - Profile display
   - Calendar view

5. **Ensure responsive design** with Tailwind CSS

## Next Steps

Since the current directory contains files that would conflict with a new Next.js project, we should:

1. Create a new directory for the Next.js project
2. Initialize the Next.js project there
3. Migrate the functionality from the current HTML/JS files to the new Next.js components
4. Test all features against the backend API

This approach will allow us to keep the existing code as reference while building the new application.
